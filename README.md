### ⚡ Generating Showcase Data

StreamUI uses an automated script to generate `showcase-data.json` for the dynamic component showcase.

Run:

```bash
npm run generate:showcase
```

This will:
- Extract readable props from your hardcoded implementations.
- Automatically generate a clean `showcase-data.json` used in the showcase gallery.
- Preserve your manual `implementation` entries while keeping your props up to date.

Run this whenever you add or update components to keep your showcase data current.
